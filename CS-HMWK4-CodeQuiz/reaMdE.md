This is the fourth homework assignment of the BCS.  
The task was to create a multiple choice quiz app, with questions pertaining to Javascript, web API's, and other topics covered in this section of the course. Said app was to be initiated by a user clicking a "start button", which would then intitiate a timer, of a predetermined length of time, and prompt the first of a set of questions to appear. With the timer and question set widgets concurrently kicked off, the first question would be answered via one of four possible answers to be chosen. After answering a question, the user would be notified whether their choice was right or wrong; the former would yield them a set amount of points added to an overall score tally, the latter would cause a 10 second decrement to the timer. In either case, the next question in the set would appear, and the process would repeat. The quiz would cease to run if all of the questions in the set were answered, or if the timer reached 0. After the quiz's end, the user would be presented with their overall score for the session, as well as being present the option of inputing their initials to have their score ID'd and entered into a scoreboard of other users who've taken the quiz.
